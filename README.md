# Twitter-vs-Keras
## Syntax
#### Twitter API
Twitter API are straight forward in syntax, user friendly designed. Most of it's functions are based on create(POST), read(GET), update(PUT), delete(DELETE) actions. This formalized designing strategy helps users to build their own function easily. Also, Twitter API provides user with packaged functions, especially those related to Twitter website. For example, Twitter API has build in functions surpporting information lookup, information management and other list generation.


For example:

- In a Manage Like Function(https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code/blob/main/Manage-Likes/like_a_tweet.py)

We use 'Get' to get tokens and keys we need:

We use 'Post' to make request:

- In a Manage Tweet Function(https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code/blob/main/Manage-Tweets/delete_tweet.py)


We use 'Delete' to delete our target:

#### Keras API
Keras API is different from Twitter API in many ways. From a functional insight, Keras is a open source Artificial Neural Network dataset. It has many build in deep learning models.

In this case, the usecases of Keras API are mostly model based:

- model.layers returns a list, the list contains all objects that have been created. For example:'keras.layers.Dense'.
- model.inputs returns a list, this list contains  the type of data received by the input of the model. 
- models.output returns a list, this list contains the type of data recieved by the output of the model.
- models.summary returns the structural information, total parameter quantity and learnable parameters.
- model.get_ config returns a dictionary that contains the structure and compilation information of all objects of the model. Keras can use this information to build a new model.
- model.get_ weights returns a list. Each member in the list is a model weight in the form of numpy array. The order of the list is input to output.
- model.set_ weights (pre_trained_w) specifies all weights of the model. The specified weight must be the same as that of the model get_ Weights returns the same weight size.
- model.to_ yaml outputs the structure of keras model as a yaml file without model weight. After the output is completed, the keras model can be imported from the yaml file.
- model.save_ weights (filepath) saves the weight of keras model as HDF5 file, and specifies the file path filepath at runtime.
- model.load_ weights (filepath, by_name = false) export the weights to the model from the HDF5 file. model. load_ Weights usually only accept model save_ For the files output by weights, you need to specify by when receiving files from other sources_ Name = true, and the variable name of HDF5 is required to be the same as the name of the model layer object.
## Entity versus procedural 
#### Twitter API
Twitter API contains only 4 kinds of operation: 
- GET, 
- POST, 
- PUT, 
- DELETE

These CRUD operations: create(POST), read(GET), update(PUT), delete(DELETE) made up most of twitter api.

Though the commands is organized by function groups, all basic operation is based on the data stucture, the entity of tweets. Thus user can have a easy start using these API command without knowing the actual procedure or state of the operation.

Also, the data relationship, or, data structure, is inherit in the call. Take the call "DELETE /2/users/:source_user_id/blocking/:target_user_id" as an example, we can see how the blocking list is organized, and we can tell that the blocking list is under source_user_id. The hierarchy is clearly shown in the call.

#### Keras API
Keras API contains a huge amount of functions and procedures, and is organized (or catagorized) under function types. For example, "model", and functions under model contains "model.fit", "model.compile", "model.evaluate", etc. 

As we can see, Keras API provide us only functions, or, group of functions to access. 

Unlike Twitter API, we have nothing to know about its data structure, and we do not care about this, nor do we have any data structure to be edited. For a deep learning API, we only need to use function calls --- the action that need the API to complete. I think this is why Keras is designed to be a procedure API instead of a Entity based one.

### [Keras API](https://keras.io/)

Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research.  

Keras is:
* **Simple** -- but not simplistic. Keras reduces developer cognitive load to free you to focus on the parts of the problem that really matter.
* **Flexible** -- Keras adopts the principle of progressive disclosure of complexity: simple workflows should be quick and easy, while arbitrarily advanced workflows should be possible via a clear path that builds upon what you've already learned.
* **Powerful** -- Keras provides industry-strength performance and scalability: it is used by organizations and companies including NASA, YouTube, or Waymo.
