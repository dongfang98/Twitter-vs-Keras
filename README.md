# Twitter-vs-Keras
## Syntax
#### Twitter API
Twitter API are straight forward in syntax, user friendly designed. Most of it's functions are based on create(POST), read(GET), update(PUT), delete(DELETE) actions. This formalized designing strategy helps users to build their own function easily. Also, Twitter API provides user with packaged functions, especially those related to Twitter website. For example, Twitter API has build in functions surpporting information lookup
#### Keras API
## Entity versus procedural 
#### Twitter API
Twitter API contains only 4 kinds of operation: 
- GET, 
- POST, 
- PUT, 
- DELETE

These CRUD operations: create(POST), read(GET), update(PUT), delete(DELETE) made up most of twitter api.

Though the commands is organized by function groups, all basic operation is based on the data stucture, the entity of tweets. Thus user can have a easy start using these API command without knowing the actual procedure or state of the operation.

Also, the data relationship, or, data structure, is inherit in the call. Take the call "DELETE /2/users/:source_user_id/blocking/:target_user_id" as an example, we can see how the blocking list is organized, and we can tell that the blocking list is under source_user_id. The hierarchy is clearly shown in the call.

#### Keras API
Keras API contains a huge amount of functions and procedures, and is organized (or catagorized) under function types. For example, "model", and functions under model contains "model.fit", "model.compile", "model.evaluate", etc. 

As we can see, Keras API provide us only functions, or, group of functions to access. 

Unlike Twitter API, we have nothing to know about its data structure, and we do not care about this, nor do we have any data structure to be edited. For a deep learning API, we only need to use function calls --- the action that need the API to complete. I think this is why Keras is designed to be a procedure API instead of a Entity based one.

#### [Twitter Premium v1.1](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/premium)
The premium Search Tweets offering provides access to the past 30 days of Twitter data or to the full history of Twitter data dependent on the endpoint selected.

These endpoints provide functionality beyond whatâ€™s available in our standard search endpoint, including:

    1. More Tweets per request
    2. Higher rate limits
    3. A counts endpoint that returns time-series counts of Tweets (only available at paid tiers)
    4. More complex querying tools
    5. Metadata enrichments, such as expanded URLs and improved profile geo information

#### [Twitter Enterprise](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise)

The Twitter enterprise APIs offer the highest level of access and reliability to those who depend on Twitter data. Perfect as you scale beyond premium and need more reliable access, custom tailored packages, or longer-term contracts. Enterprise API access comes with dedicated account managers and personalized technical support.

### [Keras API](https://keras.io/)

Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research.  

Keras is:
* **Simple** -- but not simplistic. Keras reduces developer cognitive load to free you to focus on the parts of the problem that really matter.
* **Flexible** -- Keras adopts the principle of progressive disclosure of complexity: simple workflows should be quick and easy, while arbitrarily advanced workflows should be possible via a clear path that builds upon what you've already learned.
* **Powerful** -- Keras provides industry-strength performance and scalability: it is used by organizations and companies including NASA, YouTube, or Waymo.
